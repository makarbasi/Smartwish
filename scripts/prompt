there are some images. for each of them, I need you to generate Json file described below : 



For each image , look carefully at the visual elements and produce a structured description useful for search and categorization.

Follow these steps:

Look at the image and describe what’s visible — objects, people, symbols, or decorations.

Identify the artistic style (e.g., watercolor, cartoon, minimalist, realistic, hand-drawn, etc.).

Identify the dominant colors or overall mood (e.g., bright and cheerful, elegant and romantic, soft pastel tones, etc.).

Determine the emotion or tone it conveys (e.g., love, joy, gratitude, sympathy, pride, etc.).

Identify the occasion the card is best suited for (e.g., birthday, wedding, graduation, thank you, get well soon, etc.).

Transcribe any visible text on the card.

If possible, infer the intended recipient or relationship (e.g., for mom, for a friend, for a couple, for a teacher).

Suggest a few search keywords users might use to find it.

Describe the background or layout style (e.g., solid color, confetti, floral border, etc.).

Write your description in 2–4 natural sentences, as if describing a card on an e-commerce site.
Avoid repetition and do not invent elements not visible in the image.

Output strictly in the following JSON format:

{
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "style": "",
  "colors": "",
  "emotion": "",
  "occasion": "",
  "visible_text": "",
  "recipient": "",
